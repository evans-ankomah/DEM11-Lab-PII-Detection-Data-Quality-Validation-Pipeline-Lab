You are a junior data engineer. Open and follow the instructions in `task.md` exactly (do not restate them). Implement the lab as a production-style Python project with: clean modular code (separate modules for profiling, cleaning, validation, PII detection, masking, reporting), structured logging to file/console, robust error handling (fail-fast + clear failure reports), config-driven paths/settings, basic unit tests for validators/maskers, deterministic runs (same input → same output), and a single entrypoint command that runs end-to-end and writes all required deliverables to an output folder. Include a concise README with setup + how to run.
